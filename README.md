## About This Repository

This repository contains solutions to Advent of Code problems, which is an annual programming challenge that runs from December 1st to December 25th. Each day presents two programming puzzles that test your problem-solving skills and coding abilities. The problems start simple and gradually increase in difficulty, making it perfect for both beginners and experienced programmers.

## Personal Context

I created this repository as part of teaching my son, **Gia Vinh** (11 years old), Python programming. I chose Advent of Code as our learning platform because it offers engaging, practical problems that are more interesting and motivating than traditional theory-based learning. Each puzzle provides a real-world context that makes learning programming concepts more tangible and fun.

Most of the solutions in this repository are written by Gia Vinh as part of his learning journey. You can see his progress through the commit history, where he gradually improves his coding style and problem-solving approaches. This repository serves as a living documentation of his growth as a young programmer, from his first attempts at solving simple puzzles to tackling more complex challenges.

Note: Sharing solutions is not against Advent of Code's policy, as they encourage learning and discussion within the community.
